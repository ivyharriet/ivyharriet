- 📍 **Where?** London, England, with my partner Sarah ✨
- :octocat: **What?** Senior Enterprise Support Manager at [GitHub](https://github.com)

Hi! I'm Ivy, and I'm a Senior Docs Content Manager at GitHub! I've worked for companies in the open source community for about 10 years; at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, for 5 years, then GitHub since 2017. As a manager I love finding ways to do things simply and beautifully, making my team a warm and supportive environment, and hiring a team that is a little different from the everyday ✨

## 👹 Stuff I enjoy 👹

- 🌇 GeoCities. Can you tell?
- 🖌️ Painting tiny models, especially Warhammer 30K!
- ⚔️ Working on my multiplayer video game project!
- 🗃️ Trying to give our house the Marie Kondo treatment!
