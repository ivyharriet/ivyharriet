Hi! I'm Ivy, and I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at Peatix! I've worked for companies in the Linux and open source world for over 10 years; at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, for 5 years, then GitHub for 5 and a half, and now Peatix. As a manager I love finding ways that we can do things thoughtfully and making my team a warm and supportive environment. ✨
