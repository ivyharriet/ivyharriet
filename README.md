- 🌈 **Who?** Ivy Alexander (She/Her)
- 📍 **Where?** London, England, with my partner Sarah ✨
- :octocat: **What?** Senior Enterprise Support Manager at [GitHub](https://github.com)

Hi! I'm Ivy, and I'm a Senior Enterprise Support Manager at GitHub! I've worked in support for mostly Linux-related stuff for about 10 years. I worked at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, for 5 years, then joined GitHub in 2017. As a manager I love finding ways to do things simply and beautifully, making my team a warm and fun environment and hiring a team that is little different from the everyday ✨
