<p>I'm Ivy, and I'm a Senior Enterprise Support Manager at GitHub! I've worked in support for Linux stuff for about 10 years, starting out at Canonical, the company that backs Ubuntu and then joining GitHub in 2017. I love doing things simply and beautifully, making my team a safe and warm environment and hiring people that are a little different from the everyday ✨.</p>
