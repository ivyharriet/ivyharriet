<p>I'm Ivy, and I'm a Senior Enterprise Support Manager at GitHub! I've worked in support for mostly Linux-related stuff for about 10 years. I started out at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, then joined GitHub in 2017. I love finding ways to do things simply and beautifully, making my team a warm and fun environment and hiring a team that is little different from the everyday ✨</p>
