Hi! I'm Ivy, and I'm a Senior Docs Content Manager at GitHub! I've worked for companies in the open source world for about 10 years; at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, for 5 years, then GitHub since 2017. As a manager I love finding ways that we can do things thoughtfully and beautifully and making my team a warm and supportive environment. ✨

## 👹 Stuff I enjoy 👹

- 🖌️ Painting tiny models, especially Warhammer 30K.
- ⚔️ Working on my multiplayer video game project.
- 🗃️ Trying to give our house the Marie Kondo treatment.
